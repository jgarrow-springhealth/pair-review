 * changed Markdown files.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: every block's inner HTML goes through the SAME
 * `renderMarkdown` pipeline already used for comments (markdown-it +
 * DOMPurify, see utils/markdown.js) — no new sanitizer allowlist is
 * introduced. The tracking attributes this module cares about
 * (`data-block-index`, `data-start-line`, `data-end-line`) are assigned in
 * JS via `element.dataset` AFTER sanitization, on wrapper elements THIS
 * module creates with `document.createElement` — they are never part of
 * the sanitized (repository-controlled) HTML string, so repository content
 * can never forge them to redirect a comment. Comment targets are always
 * resolved from this controller's own `this.blocks` array (by index),
 * never by re-reading attribute VALUES back out of the DOM.

   *
   * WHY A CAP EXISTS. Every nested target adds a real `<button>`, a click
   * listener and a tab stop. The Rendered-mode size ceiling in pr.js
   * (`RENDERED_MARKDOWN_MAX_SOURCE_CHARS` = 200 KB /
   * `RENDERED_MARKDOWN_MAX_SOURCE_LINES` = 5000) bounds the SOURCE, not the
   * number of nested elements that source can expand to: a 5000-line,

   * ~45,000 targets — i.e. ~45,000 buttons/listeners/tab stops, measured at
   * roughly 2.5× the render cost of the same document with nested targets
   * off. Those ceilings were tuned before nested targets existed.
   *
   * WHY 5000. It is the same order as the line ceiling (one target per
   * source line is already far more than any human document needs: the
   * pathological cases are all machine-generated tables), it keeps the
   * worst case well inside the pre-existing render budget, and no realistic
   * reviewed document comes close (a 5000-item list is exactly at it; a
   * 1000-row × 3-column table is ~4000).
   *
   * BEHAVIOUR AT THE CAP. Top-level BLOCK affordances are never affected —
   * every list/table/quote keeps its "comment on the whole ..." plus, so
   * commenting is always possible everywhere in the document. Only the
   * nested affordances stop. The check is made per BLOCK, before that
   * block attaches anything: a block whose full descriptor set does not fit
   * in the remaining budget attaches NONE of it, and no later block
   * attaches any either. Attaching part of a block is deliberately not an
   * option — a table with gutter cells on only some rows is ragged DOM, and

     *      resolves to a nested target present in the current document (a
     *      list item, a table row, an exact cell). The card goes in that
     *      target's block zone, labelled with the target, and the target
     *      element itself gets a comment badge. This is the only case that
     *      can tell two comments on two cells of one source line apart.
     *   1. `block` — the line is inside a rendered top-level block. The
     *      card goes in that block's comment zone (the normal case, and the
     *      unchanged behavior for every comment predating nested anchors).
     *   2. `gap`   — the line is a real line of this file that renders as
     *      no block (a blank separator line, leading/trailing blank lines,
     *      a link-reference definition). The card goes in that gap's own
     *      container, in source order, labelled with its real line range.
     *      It is NOT attached to the neighbouring heading/paragraph, which
     *      would silently claim the reviewer commented on content they
     *      never saw.
     *   3. `orphan` — the line isn't in this file's source at all. The card
     *      goes in the document-level fallback zone, still labelled with
     *      its real stored line number.
     * Every case resolves to a container, so no comment is ever silently
     * dropped from the Rendered view.
     *
     * A comment whose anchor is malformed, of an unknown version, or no
     * longer matches any target (the content moved or changed) falls
     * through to 1/2/3 — its honest line area — and is labelled as such. It
     * is NEVER re-pointed at a neighbouring item/row/cell: "close enough"
     * would misattribute a reviewer's words to content they didn't read.

     *  - DOUBLE SAVE: the submit button is disabled for the whole in-flight
     *    `onEditComment`, so one edit can never issue two PATCHes.
     *  - FAILED SAVE: stays in editing mode with the reviewer's text intact
