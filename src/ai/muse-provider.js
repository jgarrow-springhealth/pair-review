 * Split a configured command string into argv words so a multi-word command

 *
 * Only quote grouping is honoured — enough for a path containing spaces
 * (`"/Applications/My Tools/muse"`). Shell expansions (`~`, `$VAR`, pipes,
 * `VAR=x` prefixes) are NOT interpreted; a command needing those must already be
 * a wrapper script, since single-word commands never went through a shell either.
 *
 * The configured command names the muse BINARY only — never muse's `exec`
 * subcommand, which the provider supplies itself (see stripExecSubcommand).
 *
 * Empty words are dropped rather than emitted: `foo "" bar` yields
 * `['foo', 'bar']`, because an empty argv element would reach muse as an empty
 * positional prompt (and `""` alone would become `spawn('')`). `current` cannot
 * distinguish "a quoted empty token" from "no token accumulated yet" — both are
 * the empty string — so emptiness is the only thing that decides, and the old
 * `started` flag (set by an opening quote) is gone.
 *
 * @param {string} command - Raw command string from env/config
 * @returns {string[]} argv words; never empty and never containing an empty word
 * @throws {Error} on an unterminated quote, or when nothing but quotes and
 *   whitespace was supplied. Both are unrunnable, and a named error beats
 *   spawning `''` or silently gluing `foo "bar baz` into one nonexistent

 * Drop muse's `exec` subcommand from a configured command string.

 * The provider supplies `exec` itself — in `baseArgs` for the analysis path and
 * in `buildArgsForModel` for extraction — so a command configured as
 * `muse exec` would spawn `muse exec exec --json …` on BOTH paths, which muse
 * rejects. Normalizing here (rather than at each spawn site) is what keeps the
 * two paths consistent, and it runs before `useShell` is derived so a stripped
 * `muse exec` also stops needlessly going through a shell.
 *
 * DECISION — strip and warn, rather than only documenting "don't do that":
 * `<cmd> exec exec` has no valid meaning, so nothing is lost by removing it,
 * and the warning still tells the user their config is wrong. Nothing is
 * swallowed silently.
 *
 * This cannot damage a `docker exec`-style wrapper. Only a bare, unquoted,
 * TRAILING `exec` is removed, and a container-exec invocation can never end
 * with `exec` — the container and the command to run must follow it, so
 * `docker exec container muse` and `kubectl exec -it pod -- muse` both end at
 * the muse binary and are left untouched. A quoted trailing token
 * (`"/opt/my exec"`) ends with the quote character, so the pattern cannot match
 * inside quotes either.

 * Muse model definitions with tier mappings.

 * Muse exposes two real CLI model IDs per generation; everything below is a

 * `extra_args` pattern as the Codex provider:
 * - muse-spark-1.3             — $1.25/$4.25 per MTok ($0.15 cached), ~1M context
 * - muse-spark-1.3-contributor — $0.10/$0.20 per MTok ($0.002 cached), discounted
 *   because submitted content may be used by Meta for product improvement
 *
 * Muse Spark 1.3 (released 2026-09-02) is priced identically to 1.2 and is
 * strictly better (Meta reports ~20% fewer tool calls and ~25% fewer tokens;
 * DeepSWE v1.1 75.4 vs 55.0, Terminal-Bench 2.1 88.8 vs 82.9). The 1.2 ids still
 * work on the CLI and are not deprecated, but there is no reason to offer both
 * generations at the same price, so every `muse-spark-1.2-*` id is kept as an
 * alias of its 1.3 twin at the same reasoning effort. Saved councils and configs
 * upgrade in place instead of falling through to muse's own default.
 *
 * Do NOT treat the locally cached catalog (~/.local/share/muse/model-catalog/)
 * as authoritative: it lags the CLI and still listed only 1.2 after 1.3 worked.
 *
 * `--reasoning-effort` accepts minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra with
 * `--provider meta` (`none` is rejected outright; muse's own default is `high`).
 * `ultra` is behind a closed feature gate: muse prints "reasoning effort ultra
 * is not available (gate ultra_reasoning_effort is closed); using xhigh" and
 * silently runs at xhigh, whereas `max` actually runs. The top built-in is
 * therefore `max`, and the former `-ultra` ids alias onto it rather than
 * shipping a duplicate of the xhigh entries.
 *
 * Ordering matters: each reasoning effort is listed as a non-contributor entry
 * followed by its contributor twin, so that getFastTierModel() — which picks the
 * FIRST `fast` model — selects the non-data-sharing model for auxiliary work
 * like JSON extraction. Never put a contributor entry ahead of its twin.

   * SECURITY — why `useShell` stays false here even now that the prompt is off
   * argv: this spawn is not `detached`, so under `shell: true` a cancel or
   * timeout would kill only the `/bin/sh` wrapper and orphan the real CLI (see
   * the kill comment in extractJSONWithLLM). A multi-word command needs no
