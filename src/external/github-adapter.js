 * GitHub source adapter for external review comments.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *   1. `fetchComments` — combine the GitHubClient's PR-wide submitted comments
 *      with comments from the authenticated user's pending review. Adapter does
 *      NOT construct its own client; the caller injects it (dependency
 *      injection per CLAUDE.md).
 *   2. `mapComment` — translate a raw GitHub REST API row into the column
 *      shape of the `external_comments` table (see `src/database.js`).
 *
 * The dispatcher in `src/external/index.js` stamps `source = 'github'` at
 * write time, so `mapComment` does not include a `source` field — keeps
 * adapters from needing to know their own name.
 *
 * `synced_at` and the resolved local `parent_id` are also set by the
 * route/repository layer, not here.

/**

/**
 * Resolve the credentials this adapter needs to call its source system.
 * Returns an opaque `{ client }` shape; the route hands `client` straight
 * back to `fetchComments` without knowing it's a `GitHubClient`. Throwing
 * `GitHubApiError(status: 401)` keeps the existing 401 mapping at the
 * route layer.
 *
 * Binding-aware: when `repository` (`owner/repo`) is supplied, credential
 * resolution mirrors `resolveBindingForRequest` in `src/routes/pr.js` —
 * the repo is resolved to its binding key via `resolveBindingRepositoryFromPR`
 * and then to a host binding via `resolveHostBinding`, so per-repo
 * `api_host` / `token` / `token_command` / `features` apply. The
 * `GitHubClient` is constructed from the FULL binding (not a bare token),
 * so an alt-host repo routes Octokit's `baseUrl` to its `api_host` instead
 * of always hitting `api.github.com`.
 *
 * When `repository` is absent/empty the no-repo fallback is preserved
 * exactly: `getGitHubToken(config)` (top-level/env token) + a bare-token
 * `GitHubClient` (→ `api.github.com`). This keeps any caller without repo
 * context working unchanged.
 *
 * The returned shape also carries `isAltHost` so the route can drive
 * host-aware comment mapping. On the repo path it reflects the resolved
 * binding (`Boolean(binding.apiHost)`); on the no-repo fallback it is always
 * `false` (api.github.com). Alt-hosts don't implement GitHub's deprecated
 * diff-relative `position` field, so `mapComment` must anchor by `line`
 * instead — see its docstring.
 *
 * Per-PR host: for a DUAL repo (github + alt-host) the binding depends on which
 * system the PR actually lives on. The caller passes the PR's stored
 * `pr_metadata.host` via `options.storedHost` (undefined | null | api_host URL);
 * this method applies the legacy-NULL convention (`storedHostToOption`) and
 * threads the resulting `{ host }` into `resolveHostBinding`, so a dual repo's
 * alt-hosted PR resolves to the alt binding (and the line-based anchoring path)
 * instead of always hitting api.github.com two-arg. When `options.storedHost`
 * is omitted the two-arg ambiguity rule applies, unchanged.

/**
 * Map a raw GitHub review-comment API row to an `external_comments` row.
 *
 * File-level comments (`subject_type === 'file'`): GitHub's REST "list review
 * comments" returns comments attached to a whole file (not a line) with
 * `subject_type: 'file'` but STILL anchored at `line: 1, position: 1`. Taking
 * those coordinates at face value renders them as ordinary line-1 annotations
 * (the bug this handles). So when `subject_type === 'file'` we flag the row
 * `is_file_level = 1` and null EVERY line anchor (`line_start`, `line_end`,
 * `diff_position`, `original_line_start`, `original_line_end`) — a file-level
 * comment has no line to anchor to. `is_outdated` stays 0: with no line anchor
 * there is nothing to outdate, and this deliberately bypasses the position/line
 * `is_outdated` derivation below (whose null-position branch would otherwise
 * mark it outdated). The frontend renders `is_file_level` rows in the per-file
 * comments zone above the diff. Alt hosts may omit `subject_type` entirely —
 * then `isFileLevel` is false and behaviour is unchanged (acceptable; those
 * hosts don't distinguish file-level comments in this response shape).
 *
 * Host-aware anchoring (the `options.isAltHost` switch), applied only to
 * NON-file-level rows:
 *   - **github.com (default, `isAltHost` falsy)**: `position` is the signal
 *     for "outdated". A null `position` means the comment no longer maps to
 *     the current diff, so the current-anchor fields are nulled and
 *     `original_*` becomes the only authoritative anchor. This path is
 *     byte-identical to the long-standing behaviour and must not change.
 *   - **alt-host (`isAltHost === true`)**: alternate Git hosts do NOT
 *     implement GitHub's DEPRECATED diff-relative `position` field — they
 *     return `position: null` even for perfectly current comments while
 *     supplying a valid modern `line`. Keying "outdated" off `position`
 *     there would discard a good `line` and mis-flag live comments as lost
 *     anchors. So we anchor uniformly by `line`: a current comment has a
 *     non-null `line` (`is_outdated = 0`); a genuinely outdated one has
 *     `line == null` (`is_outdated = 1`, anchored via `original_*`). This
 *     works whether or not the host also happens to return `position`.
 *
 * Edge cases handled here (per the phase spec):
 *   - `apiRow.user` is null (deleted account): `author` and `author_url`
 *     both become null. No throw.
 *   - both current AND original anchors null (force-push lost anchor):
 *     still produces a row — the sync route decides whether to count or
 *     skip. We do NOT throw here.
 *   - `apiRow.path` missing: throws — `file` is NOT NULL in the schema
 *     and a missing path means upstream gave us something malformed.
 *     Failing early in the mapper is far easier to debug than a SQL
 *     constraint violation deep in an upsert loop.
 *
 * @param {Object} apiRow
 * @param {Object} [options]
 * @param {boolean} [options.isAltHost=false] - When true, use line-based
 *   anchoring (alt-host); when false/omitted, github.com position-based.
 * @returns {Object} A row matching the `external_comments` column names
